Description: Likelihood-free inference method for stochastic models.
    Uses a deterministic optimizer on simple simulations of the model
    that are performed with a prior drawn randomness by applying the inverse transform method.
    Is designed to work on its own and also by using the Julia package 'Jflimo'
    available on the git page of the project: <https://metabarcoding.org/flimo>.
